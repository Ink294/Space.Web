#### HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, which translates as hypertext markup language. It is nothing more than a language used to create web page structures by means of markers (tags) and attributes, which define how the content will be presented in a web browser.
#### CSS is one of the most important languages ​​used to order instructions regarding the appearance of a site and to present the contents of a page in an attractive way. Thus, HTML is used to structure the content of a site, while CSS, to structure its presentation.

## What did I build?
#### The project was focused on the construction of a space-themed web page, to understand the functions of HTML and CSS.
#### Various fonts from Google Fonts were used. The search for a visual division between each section was experimented with the "hr" property. In the main section, all the main content has been added, from inserting images to knowing how to set them in HTML and edit them in CSS. Subsequently, a list of anchors that would help navigate the page to space-related topics were attached. Ordered and unordered lists were placed, just like a survey. All with the purpose of being able to understand its writing and operation in HTML; and of course, an extensive learning wonder knowing all the CSS properties to edit.

## Objective of the project
#### In the TecnoloChicas Pro bootcamp, the aim is for the students to be able to handle HTML as well as CSS, and that through their own experimentation they can develop programming skills. As a first approach to the world of programming, we were given total freedom to learn on our own the various properties that both programming languages ​​have, based on a theme that was selected as a group.
